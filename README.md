# Proximity Reminders App
## Treehouse iOS Project 9

Proximity Reminders App is an app which can remind you when you are close to a location or leaving a location.

This project contains the use of:
  * Storyboards
  * UITableViews
  * Frameworks - CoreLocation, MapKit, CoreData, UserNotifications
  * MVC
  * NSFetchedResultsController
  * Data Modelling

### Project Instructions

  1. The app should include the following features:
  
      * A basic master-detail view architecture
      * Ability to create reminders
      * Ability to edit and/or delete existing reminders
      * Geo-fence a reminder to a location so that you can display an alert notification when leaving or entering the location
   
  2. The main screen should be implemented as a table view with reminders, and the user can tap to add a new reminder.
  
  3. When adding a reminder, the user can add/search for a location and associate it with the reminder. The user can then choose to be reminded when leaving or entering the location.
  
  4. When the user is about to enter or leave the location they must be presented with a location notification of the reminder.
 
### Extra Credit

  * The location associated with the reminder can be displayed on a map.
  * A geo-fenced circle will be displayed around the location. The circle should have a diameter of 50 meters.
